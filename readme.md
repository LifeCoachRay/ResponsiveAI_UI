Welcome to My Landing Page

This is a simple landing page that allows users to log in with their email address. The entire website and code were created using AI.

To use the site, simply enter your email address in the form on the homepage and click "Submit". This will log you in and store your email in local storage. A confirmation email will also be sent to the provided email address.

The page features a hero image and a navigation bar at the top. The background color is black, and the text is white, with red accents on the navigation bar and submit button. The page also includes a footer with a copyright notice.

The page includes a simple JavaScript function that validates the email address entered in the form and handles the login process. The validateForm function checks if the email is empty and, if not, logs the user in and sends a confirmation email.

Thank you for visiting My Landing Page. Enjoy your stay!
